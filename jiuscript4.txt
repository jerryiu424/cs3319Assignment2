-- the row for agent 'Hugh Grant' where his/her home city was from Springfield was not deleted because he had customers to deal with and a customer could not be created with having an agent assigned to them, and so to delete agent 'Hugh Grant' row, we can either reassign his customers to other agents or delete his customers first then delete his row.
